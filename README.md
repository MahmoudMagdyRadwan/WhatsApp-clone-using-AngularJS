# WhatsApp-clone-using-AngularJS
here a basic simple clone of whatsapp or messaging system.
1-)the user can login with the phoneNumber 
2-)after that the server validate the number and the user is authenticated
3-)the user is forwarded to user profile where he/she can view their enrolled groups
4-)on choosing a specific group, the user is forwarded to the chatroom where he can see past messages or send new text message.

Note:
this implementation is standalone without a server backend to send or receive data so i used a json file having some dummy data to make the requests.

for real implementation interacting with the server use the commented lines of code instead of used ones.
